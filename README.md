## Than shortcut-cli is made for you, you just need to type these two command to install it :

''
make prepare
sudo make install
''

And for executing the program :

''
. ./shortcut.sh
''

## You can add it to an alias for a faster experience

example : 

for zsh = "alias s='f() { . ~/Code/shortcuts/shortcut.sh }f;'"
